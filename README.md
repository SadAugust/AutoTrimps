## Standalone Mods Installation

The following mods are included in AutoTrimps but are also available as standalone versions:

-   Farm Calculator (zfarm)
-   Heirloom Calculator
-   Auto Perks (Perky+Surky)
-   SpireTD Import (U1 Z200+)
-   Mutator Presets (U2 Z201+)

The preferred way to load these is through another mod called ModLoader which allows you to select mods (including ones not listed above) you would like to load and it'll load them all when you launch the game. Instructions for that can be found <a href="https://github.com/GodNooNoo/TrimpsModLoader/blob/main/README.md">here</a> at GodNooNoo's ModLoader repository.

Alternatively you can load these mods seperately by following the instructions in the links below.
