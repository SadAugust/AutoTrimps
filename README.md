# AT Script Installation

## Browser

Step 1: Install TamperMonkey

https://www.tampermonkey.net/

Step 2:

Click this link: https://github.com/SadAugust/AutoTrimps/raw/main/userFiles/AutoTrimps.user.js

If clicking the link does not work, copy the contents of user.js into a new script inside tampermonkey.

If you are unsure how to do that, copy this:

```js
function loadScript(id, src) {
	const script = document.createElement('script');
	script.id = id;
	script.src = `${src}`;
	script.setAttribute('crossorigin', 'anonymous');
	document.head.appendChild(script);
}

offlineTimeSpeed = game.global.timeWarpLimit;
game.global.timeWarpLimit = 0;
loadScript('AutoTrimps-SadAugust', 'https://SadAugust.github.io/AutoTrimps/AutoTrimps2.js');
```

Press F12 inside the game, this opens the console, and paste the text into it and hit enter, this will load the script. You will have to do this everytime you refresh the game though so I recommend getting tampermonkey to do it for you!

Step 3:

Configure settings. Will NOT work as intended with default settings.

## Steam

Step 1:
Go to this link to open the mods.js file: <a href="https://github.com/SadAugust/AutoTrimps/raw/main/userFiles/mods.js">mods.js</a>  
Then, right click, hit "Save as...", and save the mods.js file somewhere to your computer where you can find it, like desktop.

Step 2:

In your Steam Library (where you see all your games in the Steam app), right click on Trimps, go to Manage, then Browse local files.  
A folder where Trimps is installed inside Steam should open.  
![Go to Trimps directory](https://imgur.com/cr35LK2.png)

Inside this folder, navigate to the mods folder (you should be in Steam\steamapps\common\Trimps\mods), and place the mods.js file there, like so:  
![Insert mods.js](https://imgur.com/muW6cUh.png)

Advanced users: If you have other mods installed then just copy the text in AT's mods.js and place it somewhere in your existing mods.js file.

Step 3:

Configure your settings. AT will not work properly if they are not configured!

Step 4:

Restart the game, or if the game is already running, hit F5 to refresh.

-   Note for Farm Calculator (zfarm)

This works in both universes and shows you the optimal stance/equality level to use for the map shown. The information for it can be found at the bottom of the Trimps breeding/trapping section as can be seen in the image below. ![Farm Calc Position](https://i.imgur.com/siZH8Dh.png)
