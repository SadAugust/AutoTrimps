# Feature Requests

1. Auto Level

    - I saw a lot of switching back and forth between 2 levels in AL2

    - Have it check the difference between 2 results and if it's within a few % use the current map

2. Misc Requests

    - feature addon request: I saw that "ignore recycled maps" messages got added, which is nice. (it's under "hide automation buttons" though, but I did read patch notes). Maybe also hide challenge specific book ignores? Like speedmining in a lot of challenges, breed in trap, etc
